Observable Trends: 

-Males make up the vast majority of the player base clocking in at just over 84% of total players and as expected with such a large majority are also responsible for largest purchase count and total value of all purchases. 

-The two age groups that made up the highest average purchase price were players age 35-39 and players <10 years of age. This suggests that adults between 35 and 39 are in a financially stable enough position to spend higher amounts on video games and the children under 10 years of age were likely relying on money sourced from a parent or guardian of a similar age to 35-39 group.

-The age group 40+ not only accounted for the fewest total purchases but also one of the lowest average purchase prices. The fact that just one age group below them accounts for the highest average spending per person suggests to me that adults over 40 simply have less interest in spending money on this type of product rather than there being any financial reason for their lack of spending.
